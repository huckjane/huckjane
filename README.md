Hi, I'm Marsha Jelleff.
I am a New York City based Software Engineer and Junior Cybersecurity Analyst.

I first started using GitHub many years ago for school projects but then abandoned my repositories for several years, coding in the dark by Vim.
Now, I have a renewed interest in publishing my code publically, sharing my mistakes and discoveries along this journey (for better or worse), 
in a effort to contribute to the development of our open source universe.

I am open to comments, critisisms, constructive advise, and connecting to other developers.
May your coding journey lead you to new adventures!
